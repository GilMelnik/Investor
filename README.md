# Stocks Data Management Web App

This is a Flask-based web application for fetching, processing, and downloading financial data for S&P 500 companies. The data is retrieved, processed into a CSV file, and made available for download. The application also includes a progress bar to monitor the update process.

## Features
- Fetches financial data for S&P 500 companies.
- Saves data as a CSV file.
- Provides a downloadable link for the latest data.
- Displays the last update timestamp and time since last update.
- Includes a progress bar for real-time update tracking.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   If running on your local machine, add the following lines to `app.py` before executing it:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```
   Then start the server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   If using PythonAnywhere, these lines should **not** be included, as the application will be managed by the PythonAnywhere web service.

4. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
